<h1> How To Contribute & Earn XUC </h1>

Yay! Kudos for being a part of Exchange Union & help build XUD, our node software! Any contributions are welcome no matter how big or small. From typos and bug fixes to entire modules - you will be awarded with XUC, our token.

Here is how it works:
1. Grab a task from [here.](https://github.com/ExchangeUnion/xud/issues)
2. Each task carries a range of XUC to be earned, like e.g. 50-100 XUC. The higher the reward, the more complex - grab a task which best fits your time at hand & skill set.
3. Comment to let everyone know you'll be working on the task, and fork the repository to get started.
4. [Get in touch](https://gitter.im/exchangeunion/Lobby) for help on the way, especially for testing. Our automation is still in the works :/
5. When you feel ready, submit a pull request  against the `master` branch with your <b>ether address (!)</b> in the comment section
6. For non-trivial changes, expect some review rounds and quite some testing to take place before your changes get merged into master
7. After a successful merge into master we'll send you your XUC. For now this is all manual work on our end, but pleeease propose a solution to automate this process (& propose a price tag)!

Goes without saying that you can exchange XUC to other assets on [various exchanges](https://www.exchangeunion.com/xuc).

If you see something missing or want to develop another cool feature or bug fix which doesn't have an issue yet, open one and we'll review and give it a price tag asap! We don't recommend working on things without an issue on github.
